DESCRIPTION \u00b6 Dataverse is an open source web application to share, preserve, cite, explore, and analyze research data. See: https://dataverse.org/about . It has several APIs that enable programmatic access. See: https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/api/index.html . This library facilitates accessing this API from Scala and Java code. INSTALLATION \u00b6 To use this library in a Maven-based project: Include in your pom.xml a declaration for the DANS maven repository: <repositories> <!-- possibly other repository declarations here ... --> <repository> <id>DANS</id> <releases> <enabled>true</enabled> </releases> <url>https://maven.dans.knaw.nl/releases/</url> </repository> </repositories> Include a dependency on this library.
